    <h1 class="journal-title">maladaptive daydreaming</h1>
    <div class="journal-content">
 <p> so i was doing duolingo lessons and playing pokemon go on my phone and therefore looking down at my phone while walking. in an empty apartment complex. and out of nowhere a fat white man with a beard wearing a trump hat starts yelling at me. i had nothing political on my person.</p>
 <p>and he says, 'who you texting? yeah, i'm talking to you, who you texting?' and he starts walking towards me. and he gets within arms length of me and he's coming at me in such a walk that he clearly intends me harm -- he's looking to fight.</p>
 <p> and i'm confused and being inexperienced in the ways of irrational persons, try to engage and deescalate, because i truly don't understand what it is he's upset about</p>
 <p>and he just keeps coming at me. at this point, i process that he thinks i'm texting someone. who? why? i don't know... perhaps he thought i saw him do something i wasn't supposed to see, but i was, again, playing on my phone minding my business</p>
 <p>so maybe the dude was dealing drugs or something, who knows, and i don't care</p>
 <p>but he followed me, acting like he was about to start swinging, halfway around this complex, hollering "where you goin'?" n shit, before i finally found a path into the main area of the complex where there might be people. i took it, and he stopped following me, but i knew if he stayed standing there, he'd see which unit was mine, and i to this day don't know if he did this.</p>
 <p>and i called the police. the critic in me hears all the activists protesting, but i'm scrawny and don't own a gun. my options for self defense are limited and he was a threat and my body screamed danger. </p>
 <p>for days it screamed danger. and what happened after is what this post is mainly about.</p>
 <p>***</p>

 <p>leading up to my walk -- I mean, I had been walking before, it was part of my rehabilitation from a relapse of paralysis issues in my legs -- but leading up to this walk, I had near completed a novel for NaNoWriMo (RIP).</p>
 <p> so i was really in this other world i had created in my head, and the next thing i knew, it was two months later.</p>
 <p>I don't know how to explain it. I don't have memory loss, but it's like that whole time was a dream -- a daydream, technically. Only it was the same one, replayed, back to back, marathon, all day every day, from the time I woke up to the time I fell asleep. I daydreampt. And I daydreampt one intentional daydream on purpose -- only I didn't keep it in my head. I acted this shit out. I acted out my daydream. I had conversations out loud with people I knew well and good weren't there, but they were there in my head -- and I do not mean hallucinations. No, I was not seeing or hearing anyone else, but I was imagining them into my surroundings nonetheless.</p>
 <p>I still do this.</p>
 <p>I did it as a kid, too, I remember. Back then, I remember I would be in the classroom. And I'd think, I'd rather be in a daydream. Of course I would not talk out loud while in the classroom -- but I did on the playground.</p>
 <p></p>

<p>when i finally "woke up" and realized i'd been living the same scenario day in and day out for well over a month, i realized i hadn't spoken to any real people. i opened my skype (before it was teams) app and saw that my partner and i had barely spoken. my messages were short. he wasn't messaging as much because i simply wasn't responding. in some ways now, i'm bothered that he allows me to pull away like this. because he does it during fights too. that's another blog post. keeping it centered here now, i messaged him apologizing for being distant, and he commented that indeed -- i'd been distant. i cried. we video called. i'm so sorry still. i disappeared. but it wasn't intentional and i didn't even realize i was doing it. i was just enjoying myself and the company of those i imagined into my surroundings -- they provided comfort, presence, so that i was not alone, because to be alone, i think i realize now, to be alone made me vulnerable -- to someone coming and attacking me. of course, what would an imaginary friend do to protect me if mr. trump hat were to break in? </p>
<p>of course, what would my long distance lover do if mr. trump hat were to break in?</p>
<p>***</p>

<p>so it's weird because, like, i need to live alone. i actually cannot live with others. i've tried and i hate it. i need my space, i need my privacy -- i need to be able to talk out loud "to myself" and have these daydreams that i have. these conversations with fictional characters from worlds i create or from books or movies -- they keep me sane, they help me process. they are company when real company would bring difficulties of social relations. if i fuck up in the company of those in my head, we just start the scenario over. you can't do that with real people -- they wanna talk about it. i don't wanna talk about it.</p>
   
<p>***</p>
<p>and i really thought i was ok, ya know? i thought i was ok. 'ok' meaning -- i only do this shit in the privacy of my own home. i can mask it in public, be present in public. </p>
<p> but i caught myself the other day talking out loud to fake people in the break room at work.</p>
