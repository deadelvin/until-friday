    <div class="journal-content">
 <p>i am dead. may as well be, it feels like. i don't feel anything, hardly even sadness -- but i cry. i sob.</p>
    <p> i know what's right and i don't do it. i am basically evil and never happy or satisfied. gratitude is fake or forced unless i am dancing, running, or writing. and my physical condition at present prevents me very literally from the former two -- remitting-relapsing paralysis. </p>
    <p>so this is the typical symptom: loss of interest in things i used to love. i know what they meant now when they said they would smile. i see it in others now, that they don't like depressed people, and that's why depressed people smile. otherwise nobody likes us, and that makes it worse.</p>
    <p> i hurt others because i cannot feel and they feel. feelings are just nerves and mine are damaged. injure nerves enough and they stop feeling, stop working. the doctors don't know what's wrong with me and don't care to help. you think i'm dramatic? try me: five referrals to neurologists declined because the neurologists "don't see anything" on the MRIs. yet this is clearly a neurological issue. </p>
        <p>a person [said i'm negative] -- i have never been called this before, and never thought of myself as this before, and might be too much of a narcissist to believe it because instead i just get angry and think ‚Äòwell, fuck you.' but now i notice my family thinks i am too negative, too.</p>
    <p> but it all started with the physical medical issue that paralyzed me. i was fine before that. nobody treated me this way before because i had no reason to be sad before and was fulfilled. i worked, i volunteered, i had friends, i was independent. and then i couldn't walk and was stuck in bed and lost it all.</p>
    <p>nobody really likes me anymore.</p>
    <p>how long does the world expect us -- those it hates -- to wait around for love. people are so annoyed with depressed pessemists, they don't want to deal with us or listen to us. but then they say "talk to someone‚Äù ‚Äì and they‚Äôll suggest friends, friends suggest talking to friends, and then don‚Äôt want to hear it. 
<p>in my daydreams i obsess. mostly over romance. in real life, although i‚Äôm a romantic, i don‚Äôt obsess over finding love. i‚Äôve never been boy crazy. but sometimes, especially when it‚Äôs rocky with him, especially since he called me what he did, all i want is to be loved in that way, that twilight way that filled my formative years, that abusive way i learned from books ‚Äì i crave the abuse despite that i have never been abused myself. only from secondhand books did i learn this numbness. </p>
<p> so with regard to love, they say, "it'll get better just keep waiting. someone will come along that is just right for you." </p>
    <p> when.</p>
    <p>and i remember this is how i was in high school. in high school, i predicted it: nobody but my family in this world will love me. </p>
<p>if i had known how much sadder the revision would be -- "nobody in this world will love me."</p>

    <p>(edit: i am grateful to my parents. i originally drafted this thinking they were annoyed with me to an extent that i truly had no one, but we talked and they do love me. they said not to feel bad but i do feel bad that they have worked so hard to help me and here i am in my thirties just...drowning.)</p>
    <p>and i wonder now if i blame him. he was safe, and i fear i'll never find such safety again. </p>
    <p>because (and while i can rationally say there are exceptions, which i don't want to say because it is not how i feel), writ large, nobody loves trans people. </p>
    <p>i can hear you, reader, protesting, and that's the problem: </p>
<p> you‚Äôre not listening to me. </p>
    <p>nobody listens to me.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>i'm anonymous here, i hope. i try. anonymity is a privilege afforded to those in majority groups. if i told you who i was -- my gender, my sexuality, my ethnicity, what i do -- you'd find me in five seconds. but the problem is that so many of my problems stem from issues unique to those categories, so how can i vent without being found out? i can't. and therein lies another of my problems.</p>
    <p>not only is it that nobody listens to me, it's that i can't talk to anyone. it used to be him and he requested i stop. and i get it. he's got his own shit going on. i became too negative for him, and he's worked hard to escape this same hole that i've found. so he's gotta leave me. so i'm abandoned.</p>
    <p>so i'm abandoned.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>just hold out till friday.</p>
    <p>I woke up at six this morning because last friday i scheduled a therapy appointment and i thought it was for today. it was supposed to be at 6:30am. all the other options were during work hours, and i haven't quit my job yet though i want to and have only been in it for less than three months. that's a whole other vent -- which i gotta do now because i gotta. i have never worked a monday-to-friday, 9-5 before. i can't say what i've done up to now because you'll know who i am if i do, but suffice to say i am used to salary, not hourly, and working from home, and having complete and total freedom--the supervisors of my profession never check in, so i have never had to "answer to" anyone, as i have been in that field since 2018. i am used to total freedom and trust, and i hate the way my new job has a supervisor who requests to know every little thing i do. i find check ins offensive ‚Äì a sign of distrust, a belief that i am incompetent and can‚Äôt do my job without oversight. seems i can't do anything without permission. about to go to a meeting and ask if i can wipe my ass after taking a sh*t. for real. i am a grown man, why do you need to give me PERMISSION if i decide not to come to work a few days, especially if i'm not requesting to be paid for them? i refuse such control and surveillance ‚Äì the myth of american freedom is a farse. And the response ‚Äúyou‚Äôre free to quit‚Äù is hilarious ‚Äì read some Gramsci or Foucault, for fuck‚Äôs sake, anything ‚Äì anything to help facilitate the slightest exercise of that atrophied critical thinking muscle. the choice between a subordinate position in which one is not truly ‚Äúfree‚Äù and homelessness is no choice at all ‚Äì analytics of agency be damned.</p>
    <p>so i woke up at six but then realized my appointment isn‚Äôt actually until friday, three days from now. so i've just been awake when i could've been asleep and not having to think.</p>
    <p>but i just gotta hold out till friday. friday, someone will listen to me. i hope she listens to me.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>[edit: i made it to friday]</p>
