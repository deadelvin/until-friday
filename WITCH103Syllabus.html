      <p>
        I created this syllabus and am now "taking" the class. My blog contains assignments and homework I completed, reflective posts, and basically just documents my process of taking the class. Edit: after falling quite behind because I was trying to make every homework assignment polished enough to post to the blogs, I decided that I'm not going to post to every single class' blog each week. I might revise and edit drafts of assignments I complete and post them at a later date. So, some weeks the blog will be updated, some weeks it won't.
