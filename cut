                <h2>WITCH 102</h2>
                <p>Intro to English/Language Arts & (Witch)Crafts</p>
                <p>I fell behind. In order to catch up, I've regrouped and been more selective in choosing materials to engage. It was easier for me to also combine the materials of all three classes into one list -- i.e., one syllabus -- so please see WITCH 101 for the remainder of my engagement with 102 and 103 topics. See this syllabus for only the first four weeks.</p>
                <p>Course delves into the realms of spellcraft and linguistic expression. Exploring foundational principles of spell work, from harnessing intent and symbolism to casting spells for manifestation, healing, and transformation. Focus on cultivating a poetic voice, drawing from mystical traditions and personal experiences to craft spells, incantations, and enchanted written works.</p>
